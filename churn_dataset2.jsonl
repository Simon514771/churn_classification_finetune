Can you please provide me with some details on the issues you've faced, so I can better understand and address your concerns?

I've checked our coverage map and found that we are currently working on upgrading our network infrastructure in your area, which should result in improved coverage in the near future. As for the overcharge on your last bill, I've reviewed your account and found an error in the billing system. I will promptly issue a $20 credit to your account to rectify the mistake. Customer: While I appreciate the credit, I'm still concerned about the overall customer service experience. If I continue to face these issues, I'll have no choice but to switch providers.

We will take your feedback into account and work on improving our customer service.
