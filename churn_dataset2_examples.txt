I'm thinking about switching to another provider. \n\nChatbot: Hello Peter! I'm sorry to hear that you're unhappy with your current plan and our network coverage. We value you as our customer, and I'd like to apologize for any inconvenience you've experienced. Can you please provide me with some details on the issues you're facing, so I can better understand and address your concerns? \n\nCustomer: I keep getting overage charges for exceeding my data limit, and the network coverage is poor at my home and workplace.
